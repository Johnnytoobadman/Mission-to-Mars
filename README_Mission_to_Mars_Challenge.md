# Mission-to-Mars Challenge

## OVERVIEW

### Robin loves the idea of traveling to the planet Mars and she has a plan to track the data on Mars (latest news, updates and images) and store it in a database.  Her plan is as follows:

 - Use Chrome Developer tools to identify HTML components on Mars websites.

 - Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate the web scrape.

 - Use Mongo to store the data
 
 - Use Flask to display the data
  
### This challenge project will use Robin's recent work to web scrape websites about Mars, focus on the four hemispheres of Mars and include them on her existing facts and latest news and Mars Facts Webpage.  Once she has completed the scrape to her web page she will the convert the page to a mobile device view and add bootstrap3 components.  A MongoDB database will store the hemispheres data.
